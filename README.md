# PaymentSystem

This is a simple project to practice creating WPF applications. The project attempts to replicate a simple payment system where users
can add different payment options to their wallet. Users can view details about their added payment options using the drop down menu.

Another feature is creating transactions by adding item names and prices and then mixing and matching payment options to pay for transactions.
After the transaction is complete, users can view their past transactions from the past transactions drop down menu. There are still bugs and
UI updates necessary. More error checking and input validation are also still required.

A compiled/built version can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/mingtungwong/PaymentSystem/releases) section in this repository.
